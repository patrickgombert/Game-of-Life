# GameOfLife

An attempt to make the game of life as small as possible

## Rule Set Reduction

The game of life rules can be reduced by finding the grid generated by including each space around any given point in the 2d space. With this grid we can simply count the alive cells and say:

1. 3 alive cells in the grid allow the cell to be alive
2. 4 alive cells in the grid when the cell is alive allow the cell to be alive
3. 4 alive cells in the grid when the cell is dead make the cell dead
4. Any other amount of live cells in the grid make the cell dead

## The Algorithm
The world is most efficeantly stored as a Set of alive cell points. To generate a next world simply take the Set of alive cells, find their grids, and apply the above rules to the Set of points obtained from all generated grids. The resulting Set is the new world.
